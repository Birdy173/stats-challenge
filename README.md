# stats-challenge
 This is a module challenge from my Data Analytics Boot Camp. 
 This takes two CSV files with a pharmaceutical experiment. 
 It takes 249 mice with a squamous cell carcinoma tumor and analyzes drug treatments.
 The main treatment that was analyzed was Capomulin. 
 I merged the files and then double-checked for duplicated mice. 
 Then I found the summary statistics of each of the treatments.
 I created a bar plot to compare the observed mouse time points per treatment.
 I created a pie plot to figure out the ratio of female to male mice.
 I created a box plot to see potential outliers in the treatments.
 I created a line plot for the tumor volume over time of mouse l509.
 Then I created a scatter plot to compare the mouse's weight and average_tumor Volume (mm3) on the treatment Capomulin.
 I also found the linear regression equation and the correlation value between the mouse weight and average tumor volume.
